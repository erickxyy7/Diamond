# Diamond
An easy and simple programming language. Help me build it by going to the [Diamond's website](https://diamondlang.pythonanywhere.com/) then I can raise funds to continue Diamond's development.

## How to execute a Diamond program
* Clone this repository
* Run: `python3 diamond.py program_name.lang && ./a.out`

## Goal
Diamond's goal is to be faster, easier and simpler than Python and Ruby.

## Plans
My plan is to implement the object-oriented paradigm later this year.

## Learn more
You can learn more about Diamond programming language in the `docs` directory in this repository.
