# Diamond
An easy and simple programming language.

## Goal
Diamond's goal is to be faster, easier and simpler than Python and Ruby.

## Plans
My plan is to implement the object-oriented paradigm later this year.

## Learn more
You can learn more about Diamond programming language in the `docs` directory in this repository.

## Tokenizer
In order to speed up Diamond's development, the tokenizer is being written in Python. When the interpreter reaches a good level of development, I'll probably rewrite the tokenizer in C if that's the best option.
